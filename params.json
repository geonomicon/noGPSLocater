  "body": "### NO GPS Compass.\r\nAndroid Location Detection(Lat,Lng) and Direction Compass which can be used when no GPS connection is available.\r\nThe Application uses Mobile Country Codes and Mobile Network Codes to pin point the location of the user. Location obtained is usually of lower precision than GPS but higher precision than GPS is closed rooms where GPS signal is not enough to pinpoint user's location.  \r\n\r\n### API Used\r\n#### Location\r\nCombain WiFi Based Positioning API is used to get the location in Lat, Lng from MNC, MCC and CID(Cell Id) of mobile network which we can get by using GsmCellLocation and TelephonyManager classes of Android.\r\n\r\n#### Direction\r\nFor Direction identification, two types of compass are there, High Precision High Power consumption Magnetometer Compass and Low Precision Low Power Consumption Accelerometer Compass.\r\n\r\n#### BaseMaps\r\nGoogle Maps is used for Basemaps for plotting Location obtained from the Combain API\r\n\r\n#### Database\r\nSQLite Database for local storing of last location for tracking purposes. All location point stored are retrieved from the API and not from the GPS. Location is stored as Lat, Lng along with MNC, MCC, CellId and Magnetometer reading.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nlunasunkaiser@gmail.com // [rajatsharma.rocks](http://rajatsharma.rocks)",
